                    <p class="attractions-p">   Mallalli Falls is a breathtaking waterfall nestled in the Western Ghats of Coorg (Kodagu) district, Karnataka. Formed by the Kumaradhara River, the falls cascade over 200 feet at the foot of the Pushpagiri Hills, creating a mesmerizing two-step waterfall amidst lush greenery.</p> 
                    <p class="attractions-p"><strong>üåø Highlights</strong></p>
                    <p class="attractions-p"><strong>Height & Formation: </strong>The falls drop from a height of approximately 200 feet, offering a stunning visual spectacle. <br>
                    <strong>Best Time to Visit: </strong>The ideal time is during the monsoon season, from June to September, when the water flow is at its peak, and the surrounding landscape is lush and vibrant.<br>
                    <strong>Activities: </strong>Visitors can enjoy a trek to the falls, with concrete steps leading down to the base. The area offers opportunities for photography and nature walks. Swimming is possible but not recommended during peak monsoons due to strong currents.</p>

The nearest village is Kumaralli, about 5 km away. From Kumaralli, a 3 km motorable road leads to Chiguru Homestay, after which a 2 km walk or a jeep ride takes you to the falls.<br>
