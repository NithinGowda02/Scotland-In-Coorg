                    <p class="coffee-text">
                        Coffee is believed to have been brought to India in the 17th century by Baba Budan, a Sufi saint.

                        On a pilgrimage to Mecca, he smuggled seven coffee beans from Yemen and planted them in the Chikmagalur region of Karnataka, just north of Coorg.

                        Arrival in Coorg:

                        By the early 19th century, during the British colonial period, coffee cultivation had reached Coorg.

                        The British recognized Coorgâ€™s ideal climate and elevation (900â€“1100 meters) and began establishing coffee plantations, primarily growing Arabica coffee.

                        British planters, along with local Kodava landowners, played a key role in developing the regionâ€™s coffee estates.</p>

                    <p class="coffee-text">
                 Coffee is a widely loved beverage made from the roasted seeds of the Coffea plant. It originated in Ethiopia and spread across the globe through trade and colonization. The two main types of coffee beans are Arabica, which has a smooth, mild flavor, and Robusta, known for its stronger and more bitter taste. Coffee thrives in tropical climates, especially at higher altitudes, where conditions are ideal for producing high-quality beans. The beans are extracted from the fruit known as the coffee cherry, then processed, dried, roasted, and ground before brewing. Popular methods of brewing include espresso, drip, French press, and cold brew. Coffee is rich in caffeine, a natural stimulant that helps improve alertness and energy levels. Beyond its taste and effects, coffee holds a special place in many cultures and communities around the world. It plays a key role in daily routines, social gatherings, and even in economic development in many coffee-growing regions. Whether enjoyed alone or with others, coffee continues to be a global favorite.
