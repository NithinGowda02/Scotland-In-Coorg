                    <p class="coffee-text">
                    Pandi Curry is the most iconic dish of Coorg cuisine, especially among the Kodava community.
                    It is made using pork meat, preferably with a good amount of fat for added flavor.
                    The dish is known for its deep, dark color and rich, tangy taste.
                    A key ingredient is Kachampuli, a unique sour vinegar made from wild Garcinia fruit, which gives it a sharp tang.
                    The pork is marinated with turmeric, chili powder, coriander powder, and spices before slow-cooking.
                    The preparation involves minimal oil, as the fat from the pork renders down beautifully.
                    The slow cooking helps the meat absorb the spices deeply.
                    It is usually served with steamed rice balls (Kadambuttu) or Akki Roti.
                    Traditionally cooked during festivals, weddings, or family gatherings.
                    Its spicy and sour notes make it a favorite even among non-locals visiting Coorg.

                                    Kadambuttu are soft, round steamed rice balls that are a staple in Coorg cuisine.
                    They are made from broken rice (akki nuchu) that’s cooked and then shaped into balls.
                    The rice is partially cooked in boiling water, cooled slightly, and then hand-shaped.
                    They have a soft yet firm texture, making them perfect to soak up gravies.
                    These rice balls are most famously paired with spicy Pandi Curry.
                    Kadambuttu is considered a traditional delicacy and often prepared during festivals and feasts.
                    They are steamed in banana leaves or bamboo baskets for a natural aroma.
                    Since they are neutral in taste, they complement both vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes.
                    The dish is gluten-free and very filling, making it a wholesome meal base.
                    Served hot with ghee or curry, Kadambuttu is a symbol of Coorgi hospitality.

                                    Baimbale Curry is a unique Coorgi dish made using fresh bamboo shoots.
                    The shoots are collected during the monsoon season, making it a seasonal delight.
                    They are soaked in water for a few days to reduce bitterness and improve digestibility.
                    Bamboo shoots are then pressure-cooked and mixed with a spicy coconut paste.
                    The curry may be vegetarian or include small prawns or pork for added taste.
                    It has a distinct earthy flavor and is usually eaten with rice or akki roti.
                    Bamboo shoot dishes are especially common in rural households of Coorg.
                    The dish is packed with fiber and considered healthy and detoxifying.
                    Traditional methods often involve fermenting the shoots for a deeper flavor.
                    It's a rustic, eco-friendly dish that highlights the region’s use of forest produce.

                                    Noolputtu are thin, soft rice noodles that resemble string hoppers.
                    They are made from a dough of rice flour that is pressed through a noodle maker.
                    These noodles are then steamed to retain moisture and softness.
                    Noolputtu is light on the stomach and typically served for breakfast or dinner.
                    It is best enjoyed with sweetened coconut milk or a spicy chicken curry.
                    Some families serve it with vegetable stew or pork curry as well.
                    Noolputtu are often prepared during special occasions or as festive food.
                    It is considered a labor of love due to the manual effort involved.
                    The dish is gluten-free and suitable for those with wheat allergies.
                    Soft, fluffy, and delicate, Noolputtu is a favorite among all age groups.

                                    Koovaleputtu is a sweet delicacy made from ripe jackfruit, jaggery, and rice flour.
                    The ingredients are mixed into a smooth batter and wrapped in banana leaves.
                    It is then steamed until it solidifies into a soft, aromatic cake.
                    The banana leaves impart a unique flavor and fragrance to the dish.
                    Koovaleputtu is most common during the jackfruit season in summer.
                    The natural sweetness of jackfruit eliminates the need for added sugar.
                    Cardamom or ghee is sometimes added to enhance the flavor.
                    It is served as a snack or dessert in Coorg households.
                    The texture is dense yet moist, and it can be stored for a few days.
                    This traditional sweet represents the connection between Coorg cuisine and local fruits.

                    <p class="coffee-text">
                 Akki Roti is a traditional rice-based flatbread that holds a special place in everyday 
                 Coorgi meals. Made with cooked rice and rice flour, the dough is kneaded and flattened by hand, 
                 then cooked on a griddle. It’s soft, slightly chewy, and goes well with spicy chutneys, 
                 vegetable curries, or meat dishes. Unlike the crispier Akki Roti of North Karnataka,
                  Coorg’s version is softer and fluffier. Often eaten for breakfast or dinner, 
                  it’s simple yet comforting, and showcases how rice is central to Coorg cuisine.

                 Kummu Curry is a seasonal delicacy prepared using wild mushrooms found in the 
                 forests of Coorg during the monsoon. These mushrooms are cleaned and cooked in a spiced 
                 coconut gravy with garlic, green chilies, and onions. The earthy flavor of the
                  mushrooms pairs beautifully with the rich, aromatic curry base. Often enjoyed with 
                  rice or akki roti, it’s a monsoon treat treasured by locals. The dish also reflects Coorg’s 
                  foraging culture and sustainable lifestyle.

                 Paputtu is a soft, lightly sweet steamed rice cake made with broken rice, fresh coconut, 
                 milk, and a hint of cardamom. 
                 It’s usually served for breakfast or as an evening snack, 
                 often accompanied by honey or ghee. The texture is somewhat spongy,
                and it has a delicate aroma from the coconut and cardamom. Unlike desserts,
                it’s not overtly sweet and can even be paired with savory curries. 
                Paputtu is both nutritious and filling, ideal for a wholesome start to the day.
